## Overview

As part of an independent project in the spring of 2015, I designed, manufactured, and implemented controls onto a robotic hand. 

A common challenge with robotic hands and grippers is adaptability to objects of different shapes and sizes. For this reason, the hand I designed is underactuated.  There is one motor or controller for each finger, rather than a motor at each joint.  This allows for selfadaptability of the hand based on the object it is grasping.  

Another step in the project was to implement a method of controlling the hand. I created programs using python scripts and ROS to send commands to each finger or specific gestures that may be useful such as creating a fist or pointing a finger. In addition, I am working on interfacing the robotic hand with a Leap Motion. The Leap Motion is a 3D controller that tracks different joints in human hands through use of infrared sensors. The image below is a visualization of the Leap Motion showing finger tracking of human hands. I am working through obtaining data of positions of each human finger to translate into position for the robotic hand to imitate motion.
