## Welcome to my portfolio!

Here you will see some of the recent projects I have been working on. If you have any questions, feel free to [reach out](http://andrewturchina.github.io/portfolio/contact/) to me with any questions.

I graduated from Miami University in 2010 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I spent four years working in the liquid and gas control industry working with a wide variety of companies in providing solutions and training to improve their process and safety.  

 After spending four years working in the liquid and gas control industry, I am now pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics at Northwestern University. My robotic's interests are in the application and design of robots in industrial applications to improve work environments and human safety.  

Outside of school and work I enjoy traveling (33 states and 3 continents so far), live music, and being outdoors.
