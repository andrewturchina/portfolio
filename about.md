## Overview
I graduated from Miami University in 2010 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. After spending four years working in the liquid and gas control industry, I am now pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics at Northwestern University. My robotic's interests are in the application and design of robots in industrial applications.  

Outside of school and work I enjoy traveling, attending sporting events, and staying active. Please feel free to [reach out](http://andrewturchina.github.io/portfolio/contact/) to me with any questions.
