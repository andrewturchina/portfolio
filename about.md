## Overview
I graduated from Miami University in 2010 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. After spending four years working in the liquid and gas control industry, I am now enrolled in the Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University.  

Outside of school and work, I enjoy traveling and staying active.
